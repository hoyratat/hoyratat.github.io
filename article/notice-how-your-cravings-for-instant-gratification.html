        <div class="article-content markdown-body"><a title="https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/110i1zm/why_you_should_make_your_bed/" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/110i1zm/why_you_should_make_your_bed/">Hi Redditors,<br class="jop-noMdConv" />my friend and I challenge each other once a week to a self-improvement experiment. Why? Because just consuming more content doesn't get you anywhere. We are firm believers that you can only <strong>improve</strong> if you <strong>take action.</strong> So we wanted to share our experiment here as well and invite you to join us! Productivity improvements guaranteed. 😃<br class="jop-noMdConv" />Okay, let’s get to it! 🚀<br class="jop-noMdConv" />👉 Today’s topic: Making your bed<br class="jop-noMdConv" />Despite the chance that this will be ‘cringy’, I picked <strong>making your bed</strong> as this weeks <strong>experiment</strong>. Why? I recently noticed that whether or not I make my bed, impacts my mood and focus for the rest of the day. It right away puts me into an ‘<strong>action taking</strong>’ state and I experience a small win for that day which I can 100% control. It also reinforces the story I tell myself:<br class="jop-noMdConv" />- Only organized and active people make their bed. —&gt; I make my bed. —&gt; I must be organized and active.<br class="jop-noMdConv" />Also, even if your day was shit, at least you can find some solace in coming home to a neat bed 😉<br class="jop-noMdConv" />If you are already making your bed, see what the impact is of putting some extra effort into making your bed this week. If you are not convinced, take Gabrielle Bernstein’s word for it:<br class="jop-noMdConv" />&gt; <em>Getting organized is a sign of self-respect.</em><br class="jop-noMdConv" />🧪 This weeks experiment<br class="jop-noMdConv" />&gt; <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> <em>Making your bed will boost your mood, and give you a feeling of accomplishment.</em><br class="jop-noMdConv" />🤌🏻 But, but, how do I best do it?<br class="jop-noMdConv" />1. Don’t be silly, you know how to make your bed.<br class="jop-noMdConv" />2. If you want to further procrastinate, you can always Google it 😉<br class="jop-noMdConv" />3. But seriously, it doesn’t take a lot of time, so try it out for <strong>7 days</strong> and see how it impacts how you feel and the productivity for the rest of the day. If it doesn’t make a difference, you can always drop the habit again.<br class="jop-noMdConv" />4. Start date: <strong>Monday 13th of Feb</strong><br class="jop-noMdConv" />5. End date: <strong>Sunday 19th of Feb</strong><br class="jop-noMdConv" />Have a great week and happy experimenting!</a> <a title="https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/10v91qf/my_tips_for_stopping_endlessly_scrolling/" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/10v91qf/my_tips_for_stopping_endlessly_scrolling/">know what the protocols are by the people around you, signs everywhere, ect.)</a></div>
