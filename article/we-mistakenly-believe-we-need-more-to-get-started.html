<p>I love this quote from Chuck Close:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us just show up and get to work. If you wait around for the clouds to part and a bolt of lightening to strike you in the brain, you are not going to make an awful lot of work. All the best ideas come out of the process; they come out of the work itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a good reminder that inspiration and motivation come from doing the work. Motivation is a reward that comes after we make a small amount of progress.</p>
<p>But how do we force ourselves to get started? With a 5-minute sprint.</p>
<p>5-minute sprints have three simple rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Eliminate all distractions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set a timer for 5 minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get to work</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Afterward, take a short break. Personally, I might grab a drink, do a sudoku puzzle, or take a walk in my basement. But I avoid time sinks that suck me in for hours. (I’m looking at you, Candy Crush!)</p>
<p>That’s it. That’s the entire process. Work for five minutes and take a break.</p>
<p>If we can get ourselves to work for five minutes, it’s not that hard to work for another five minutes. If we can do this, we can make a tiny bit of progress and get a tiny bit of motivation. And everything else takes care of itself.</p>
<p>So try it out. Try working for five minutes on that thing you’re procrastinating.</p>
<p>You can do 5 minutes, right?</p>
