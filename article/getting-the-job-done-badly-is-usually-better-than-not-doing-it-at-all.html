<p>Brushing your teeth for 10 seconds is better than not brushing. Exercising for 5 minutes is better than not exercising. Handing in homework with some wrong answers is better than getting a 0 for not handing anything in. Paying off some of your credit debt reduces the interest you'll accrue if you can't pay it all off. Making a honey sandwich for breakfast is better than not eating. The list goes on and on. If you can't do it right, half-ass it instead. It's better than doing nothing! And sometimes you might look back and realize you accomplished more than you thought you could.</p>
