Freehostia allows you to easily create a professional looking site for FREE.<br />
It offers 1-Click Application Installer for WordPress, Joomla and many more free scripts with just one click.<br />
Freehostia’s free hosting plan includes an ad-free website, host five domains, and three email accounts among many others.<br />
It also offers 24/7 customer support which is pretty amazing. This is some sort of advantage among free services, and their response time is actually quite good.<br />
The only downside I see with Freehostia.com is the small storage of only 250 MB and limited Data Center location at Chicago.<br />
But, knowing that you spend nothing. It’s still worth testing out.</p>
