<p>Pack things the day before so you don’t forget ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/digi-cow/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/digi-cow/">u/digi-cow</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t drink alcohol. Causes brain fog and it can negatively interact with medications. Alcohol can even cause ADHD-like symptoms in non-ADHD people ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/HiTechTek/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/HiTechTek/">u/HiTechTek</a><strong>,</strong> <a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/beatadhd/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/beatadhd/">u/beatadhd</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do Cardio before you need to do stuff that requires sitting. It helps you focus. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/robertaloblaw/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/robertaloblaw/">u/robertaloblaw</a><strong>,</strong> <a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/beatadhd/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/beatadhd/">u/beatadhd</a>)</p>

<p>Keep things at eye level (Especially notes/todo lists) ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/asmugone/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/asmugone/">u/asmugone</a><strong>)</strong></p>

<p>Be stupidly early to places just in case you forget something ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/asmugone/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/asmugone/">u/asmugone</a><strong>)</strong></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Take a cold shower in the morning or turn it cold just for 30-60 seconds at the end of your shower. Wakes you up, gets your blood flowing and gets you out of the shower. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/Juan_Creamsicle/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Juan_Creamsicle/">u/Juan_Creamsicle</a><strong>,</strong> <a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/beatadhd/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/beatadhd/">u/beatadhd</a>)</p>

<p>Get a therapist if you can. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/fineandnormal/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/fineandnormal/">u/fineandnormal</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you aren’t diagnosed: Actually get a diagnosis and a therapeutic programme that works for you. Don’t spend more time wondering - you’ll still feel like an imposter afterwards, don’t worry… ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/Little_Blue_Shed/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Little_Blue_Shed/">u/Little_Blue_Shed</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most important for me has been telling myself all I need to do is floss. Usually you'll end up chaining the rest of your night routine tasks like brushing onto that. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/amazona_auropalliata/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/amazona_auropalliata/">u/amazona_auropalliata</a><strong>)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>🌟 My Favourite:</strong> Enjoy the journey more than the destination, don’t be in a hurry to finish something you are doing, but always at least do something small everyday. Life is not a race, rather, it is an accumulation of smaller improvements to oneself. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/ksettle/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/ksettle/">u/ksettle</a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p><em>People are in such a rush these days… You can’t expect to become a superhuman overnight. Focus on sustainability first and enjoy the journey.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cleaning</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have a designated spot for every single item (Put it in the same place every time) ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/BrownShoeJenny/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/BrownShoeJenny/">u/BrownShoeJenny</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a “misc” basket in each room. If you’re truly unable to put something away, put it in the basket. Have a designated period of time, once a week, when your sole priority is to put everything away, all at once. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/lexid22/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/lexid22/">u/lexid22</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever you lose something that you “put away,” start keeping it in the first place you looked for it. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/FullDisclosureDaemon/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/FullDisclosureDaemon/">u/FullDisclosureDaemon</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to not get overwhelmed when cleaning, remember there are only 5 things you need to tackle: Trash, Laundry, Dishes, Putting things back that have a place, Put things in a pile that don’t have a place. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/mmc09/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/mmc09/">u/mmc09</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re moving from one room to another, take the item with you that needs to go to the other room. It’s already on your way and it’s one less thing cluttering your room. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/SweetTeaBags/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/SweetTeaBags/">u/SweetTeaBags</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you can afford it: Get a cleaning person; It takes them 3 hours to do what you can do in 3 weeks. While they are there, use them as an accountability buddy and sort out your misc tasks like paying bills. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/swarleyknope/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/swarleyknope/">u/swarleyknope</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embrace chaos. Let your brain get distracted when you’re cleaning. Cleaning dishes and stop spare trash? It’s fine go clean that and then get back to the dishes ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/DobbythehouseElff/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/DobbythehouseElff/">u/DobbythehouseElff</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a dedicated playlist for cleaning. High tempo songs help keep you moving. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/DobbythehouseElff/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/DobbythehouseElff/">u/DobbythehouseElff</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do chores before you go to bed. No matter what your routine is, you have to go to bed at some point. You can “habit-chain” cleaning into going to bed. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/bkmilli/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/bkmilli/">u/bkmilli</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>🌟 My Favourite:</strong> Listen to podcasts/audiobooks when doing chores. My excitement to listen to a new episode of my favorite podcast motivates me to do boring stuff like dishes or laundry. (I personally listen to podcasts) ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/dani-tp/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/dani-tp/">u/dani-tp</a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p><em>Cleaning became so easy once I started using a “side” to stimulate my brain. I’m mostly watching TV shows when I clean right now (this also works for cooking!) .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Memory</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Having a tablet like an iPad Pro is helpful for keeping colorful notes. Avoids issues losing notebooks ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/zombiessalad/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/zombiessalad/">u/zombiessalad</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Park in the same place every time when you go to a common place. You won’t forget where you park that way ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/gibbousboi/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/gibbousboi/">u/gibbousboi</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep a spare house key in your car and one outside your house. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/GoodGuyVik/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/GoodGuyVik/">u/GoodGuyVik</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep important items in visible and convenient locations. e.g: Take pills when you eat? Keep your bottle beside your table where you eat. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/girlabout2fallasleep/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/girlabout2fallasleep/">u/girlabout2fallasleep</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get a Tile. Bluetooth GPS trackers that are a game changer for ADHD people that lose keys/wallets. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/fizzzzzpop/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/fizzzzzpop/">u/fizzzzzpop</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tape your most often made recipes to the inside of your kitchen cabinet doors. ~ <strong>(Unknown)</strong></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Use voice assistants. “Remind me to do X tomorrow at Y time” ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/theviciousfish/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/theviciousfish/">u/theviciousfish</a><strong>)</strong></p>

<p>Use the mind palace memory exercise to help solve retention issues. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/asmugone/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/asmugone/">u/asmugone</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep forgetting your lunch? Put your keys on it. That way you can’t leave without your lunch ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/Therealdickbut/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Therealdickbut/">u/Therealdickbut</a><strong>,</strong> <a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/Maktube/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Maktube/">u/Maktube</a>, <a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/mismanager/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/mismanager/">u/mismanager</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need to remember to bring something with you the next day, place it right in front of the exit door so you HAVE to touch it before you leave the house. If it’s something in the fridge, put a sticky note on the exit door’s handle. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/lexid22/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/lexid22/">u/lexid22</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buy multiple items that you use often. Setup multiple chargers at work/home (so you have a spare if you lose one). e.g. buy 10 different lip balms so you can always find it when you need it. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/redbananass/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/redbananass/">u/redbananass</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have convenient, labeled spaces for things. It’s hard to forget your phone when you ALWAYS put it beside your charger. (Use a cheap labelmaker!) ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/TotallyLegitEstoc/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/TotallyLegitEstoc/">u/TotallyLegitEstoc</a><strong>,</strong> <a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/nathanb131/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/nathanb131/">u/nathanb131</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get a tracking tool like Tile and put it on things you lose regularly. (Keys/Wallet) ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/3GrilledJalapenos/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/3GrilledJalapenos/">u/3GrilledJalapenos</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have rules for placement of the important things in your life. (it’s too hard to do it for everything) ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/nathanb131/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/nathanb131/">u/nathanb131</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a second brain for yourself - in whatever way is most appealing to you. (I personally use Notion) ~ (<a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/significanttoday/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/significanttoday/">u/significanttoday</a>**)**</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to remember something, put an object out-of-place whilst thinking about what you want to remember. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/VectorGambiteer/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/VectorGambiteer/">u/VectorGambiteer</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Count your steps as you walk into a new room. It’ll help you remember why you entered that room. It gives you something to focus on but it’s not too much that you’ll get distracted. (This is similar to many forms of counting meditations too) ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/bethknowsbest/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/bethknowsbest/">u/bethknowsbest</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a bowl to throw your keys, badges, and wallet into when you get home. That way you can’t leave without ALL the stuff you need. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/pockunit/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/pockunit/">u/pockunit</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALWAYS have a bag with the essentials. On mine a have my keys, charger, papers and even tooth brush. If I’m going out, I do not waste time searching for everything. Just search for a bag. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/sdjrp/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/sdjrp/">u/sdjrp</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a calendar entry for every scheduled thing religiously unless it’s routine like a 9-5 job. Make the calendar entry immediately while making the appointment. Do this for parties, birthdays, dates, finals, med refills, trash night, etc. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/percyjeandavenger/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/percyjeandavenger/">u/percyjeandavenger</a><strong>)</strong></p>

<p><strong>🌟 My Favourite:</strong> Use Spaced Repetition to study for your exams, remember things about people in your life, and literally everything you can possibly make a flashcard for. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/beatadhd/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/beatadhd/">u/beatadhd</a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p><em>Is it narcisstic to put my own tip as a favourite? Well who cares, it works! Spaced repetition is fantastic and honestly</em> <em><strong>feels like cheating</strong></em>*. There are a lot of free tools out there which work great. I’m currently using my own private tool* 😉</p>

<p>Time Blindness</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set your phone clock 10-15 mins fast on purpose ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/Anonredditthoughts/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Anonredditthoughts/">u/Anonredditthoughts</a><strong>)</strong></p>

<li>
<p>Put appointments in your calendar 10-20 minutes earlier than the actual appointment ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/Alyscupcakes/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Alyscupcakes/">u/Alyscupcakes</a><strong>)</strong></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Set timers for activites you hyperfocus on. BUT set the timer for X minutes less than the task takes. (Give yourself time to wrap up whatever you’re working on) Additional Protip: Use this on a watch rather than your phone to avoid getting distracted. A basic watch/smart watch will save your life. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/dinamyte519/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/dinamyte519/">u/dinamyte519</a><strong>)</strong></p>

<li>
<p>Download an app on your phone that chimes and buzzes every half an hour during your awake time. Keeps you aware of how much time has passed. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/Frosty172/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Frosty172/">u/Frosty172</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track your time. Every morning, write out a todo list by hand and track the time taken for each task. (Write down the time whenever you take a break or switch tasks) - I personally use Toggl to track my time ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/ImprovedMeyerLemon/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/ImprovedMeyerLemon/">u/ImprovedMeyerLemon</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>🌟 My Favourite:</strong> Get an electric toothbrush with a timer. ADHD people have time blindness and it’ll make sure you brush for at least two minutes. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/insaxon/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/insaxon/">u/insaxon</a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p><em>Yes. Two minutes can feel like two hours for me. Or I’ll brush for 20 seconds and think five minutes has passed. I can’t trust my brain, so I started using an electric toothbrush with a timer</em></p>

<p>Distractions</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Use website blockers for distracting websites <em>(I use Cold Turkey, Freedom and News Feed removers for social media + Youtube)</em> ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/elliptical_orbit/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/elliptical_orbit/">u/elliptical_orbit</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get a good pair of noise-cancelling headphones + non-distracting music/audio ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/elliptical_orbit/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/elliptical_orbit/">u/elliptical_orbit</a><strong>,</strong> <a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/michaeltheobnoxious/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/michaeltheobnoxious/">u/michaeltheobnoxious</a>)</p>

<li>
<p>If you can’t stop yourself from answering that text/email/IM right away but don’t actually have time to deal with it, tell the person you’ll respond when you get a minute. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/theweirdo_nextdoor/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/theweirdo_nextdoor/">u/theweirdo_nextdoor</a><strong>)</strong></p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>🌟 My Favourite:</strong> Use a noise-cancelling headset and listen to music/white noise/brown noise. Enables hyperfocus and blocks out distractions (“I don’t regret getting diagnosed late, but I do regret getting noise cancelling headphones that late in life.”) ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/rn7889/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/rn7889/">u/rn7889</a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p><em>Stop scrolling right now and go buy the noise-cancelling headset. A noise-cancelling headset + some noise like music/brown noise is essential if you have ADHD. Feel free to thank me later once your life changes.</em></p>
<p><em>If the headset isn't in your budget: Brown noise + earphones will get you 80% of the way there.</em></p>

<p>Getting Things Done</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have an Android: Put a widget from your todo list app on your home screen so it’s the first thing you see ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/kee_kee/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/kee_kee/">u/kee_kee</a><strong>)</strong></p>

<p>Break tasks down into as many smaller tasks as you need for it to feel manageable. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/theweirdo_nextdoor/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/theweirdo_nextdoor/">u/theweirdo_nextdoor</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn to plan around transitions. It’s easier to start things if you chain them with another task that is ending. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/lexid22/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/lexid22/">u/lexid22</a><strong>)</strong></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Remember that something is better than nothing. If you only get 26% of a task done then it’s further than if you never started. It’s better to do little bits of every task rather than procrastinating. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/xxxistentialist/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/xxxistentialist/">u/xxxistentialist</a><strong>)</strong></p>

<li>
<p>Lie to yourself. I’ll tell myself that I’m just going to unload one dish from the dishwasher. Once I’ve started, I’ll at least unload a few, and maybe clean the whole kitchen. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/coffeeclichehere/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/coffeeclichehere/">u/coffeeclichehere</a><strong>)</strong></p>

Make sure it’s only 1 thing. ~ <strong>(</strong><a title="https://www.reddit.com/u/optimisticaspie/" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/optimisticaspie/">u/optimisticaspie</a><strong>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand that FUTURE YOU IS STILL YOU. If you think you’ll do something later, understand that future you is still you.

<p>Be honest about your limitations and own your shit. Most people have no idea how much adhd affects so many things and therefore can’t understand our inability to do basic things at times.
